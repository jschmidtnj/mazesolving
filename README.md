# mazesolving
A variety of algorithms to solve mazes from an input image.
Originally forked from a Computerphile project, now with some cool changes for maze generation and solving. Will eventually implement dual-side dijkstra's algorithm, which is arguably fastest for maze solving. Any input is appreciated.

## About
These are the python files for maze generation and solving. Feel free to use, alter, redistribute the code as you see fit.

## Input
Some example mazes are included in the repository.. Once exported I edited the mazes to ensure that the following rules are adhered to:

- Each maze is black and white. White represents paths, black represents walls.
- All mazes are surrounded entirely by black walls.
- One white square exists on the top row of the image, and is the start of the maze.
- One white square exists on the bottom row of the image, and is the end of the maze.
